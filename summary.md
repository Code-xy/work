 For most of the past century an inverse correlation between human fertility and economic development has been found. This means that as a country got richer, the average number of children born to each woman got smaller. While in the poorest countries women often have eight children, the rate fell as low as 1.3 in some European countries such as Italy, which is below the replacement rate. Such a low rate has two likely negative consequences: the population will fall in the long term, and a growing number of old people will have to be supported by a shrinking number of young. But a recent study by researchers from Pennsylvania University suggests that this pattern may be changing. They related countries’ fertility rates to their human development index (HDI), a figure with a maximum value of 1.0, which assesses life expectancy, average income and education level. Over 20 countries now have an HDI of more than 0.9, and in a majority of these the fertility rate has started to increase, and in some is approaching two children per woman. Although there are exceptions such as Japan, it appears that ever higher levels of wealth and education eventually translate into a desire for more children. 

在上个世纪的大部分时间里，人们发现人类的生育能力与经济发展之间存在反相关关系。这意味着，随着一个国家变得更加富裕，每个女性所生的平均子女数量也随之减少。在最贫穷的国家中，妇女通常有八个孩子，而在诸如意大利这样的一些欧洲国家，这一比率却低至1.3，低于替代率。如此低的比率有两个可能的负面影响：长期来看，人口将下降，越来越多的老年人将不得不由越来越少的年轻人提供支持。但是宾夕法尼亚大学研究人员最近的一项研究表明，这种模式可能正在改变。他们将国家的生育率与其人类发展指数（HDI）相关联，该指数的最大值为1.0，用于评估预期寿命，平均收入和教育水平。现在有20多个国家的人类发展指数超过0.9，其中大多数国家的生育率已经开始提高，在某些国家中，每个妇女的生育率接近两个孩子。尽管有日本这样的例外，但似乎越来越多的财富和教育最终转化为对更多孩子的渴望。

总结：在上个世纪的大部分时间里，人们发现人类的生育能力与经济发展之间存在反相关关系。意味着越富裕的国家，每个女性所剩的平均子女数量越少，
